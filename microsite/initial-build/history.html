            From humble beginnings in just seven U.S. newspapers, PEANUTS has grown to become not only the best-loved comic strip in history, but a true global phenomenon. Today PEANUTS is featured in online syndication and in thousands of newspapers worldwide; in classic specials and in new streaming series on Apple TV+; and in mobile apps, stage productions, feature films, and books (hundreds of them). PEANUTS has inspired theme park attractions, public art projects, and every kind of consumer product from pj’s to popcorn makers. PEANUTS speaks a universal language—and has also introduced a vocabulary all its own: “Good grief!,” “security blanket,” “You blockhead!” and “Happiness is… .”
