            <h2> Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup of neutral oil, such as sunflower or coconut</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup of honey or maple syrup</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li> 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
                    <li>3 cups of old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
                    <li>1 cup of sliced almonds</li>
                    <li>1 cup of raisins or other dried, chopped fruit</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 300°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Place 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup honey or maple syrup, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine.</li>
                    <li>Go ahead and measure 3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats and 1 cup sliced almonds right into the oil mixture — don’t worry if you add a little more oats or almonds — granola is very forgiving. Stir to coat well.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet and spread into an even layer. If the granola is clumpy, use a spatula to press it into the pan.</li>
                    <li>Bake, stirring halfway through, for about 20 minutes total. The granola is ready when golden-brown and the almonds have toasted — it will still feel wet coming out of the oven but will dry as it cools.</li>
                    <li>Place the baking sheet on a wire rack and sprinkle on 1 cup raisins or other dried, chopped fruit. If you want clumps of granola, press and tamp down the granola before it cools, which will help it stick together. Cool completely before storing.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the cooled granola to an airtight container for long-term storage at room temperature.</li>
                </ol>
